      <h3>UX Designer and Researcher</h3>

      <h5>I believe that good design is created with empathy to the people, love to the world, rigorous rationale
        and inspiring graphics. I see natural and crafted art in every detail of my life and consider design is always a
        peprfecting in process.
        I likes to question what has been done and am intrigued to discover what can be done. <br>
        <br>
        This fall I became a University of Michigan Wolverine by <span>a Master of Science in information degree in the
          School of Information focused on Human Centered Interaction</span>.
        I am taking 5 courses in learning Contextual Inquiry and Consulting Foundations, Python, Deisgn of Complex
        Websites, Introduction to
        Interaction Design, and Fundamentals of Human Behavior.<br>
        <br>
        Before I step my feet in the realm of UX design, I studied Architecture at University of Washington in Seattle.
        Influenced by family interest in the construction industry,
        I enjoy studying the history, different ideologies and methodological practice of Architecture, and my education
        background of Architecture also taught me
        how to take abstract idea to tangible work of design. I hope in the future, I will be able to use my knowledge
        in HCI to help Architects and other professionals in the industry
        with better working experience of the many tools they use.<br>
        <br>
        Aside from my academic and working experience, I spend my spare time in reading a wide range of literature from
        Plato, Rousseau to Tagore, George Orwell. I found philosophy
        and politics fascinating. I appreciate art pieces by Jackson Pollock, Monet, Raphael and etc. My favorites
        movies are directed by Quentin Tarantino, Wong Kar-Wai, and David Lynch.<br>
        <br>
        I was born in Shaoyang China, grown up in Shanghai China, and began my journal in the U.S. since 2009. Some
        favorite places I have travelled to are
        Florence, Capri, Cancun, and Carmel.<br>
